  

We are developing an **IoT-based continuous health monitoring system** to track vital health parameters in real-time. The system should monitor fetal movements, maternal blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, ensuring timely alerts in case of abnormalities.  

The prototype must integrate sensors, IoT connectivity (Firebase, ThingSpeak, or Blynk), and a GSM module to transmit data and send alerts to caregivers or doctors. A mobile app or web dashboard should display live health metrics, enabling remote monitoring and analysis.  

Solutions will be evaluated based on technical implementation, code quality, accuracy, and innovation. Participants are encouraged to optimize their system for efficiency, reliability, and real-world usability. Bonus points for incorporating AI/ML-based anomaly detection.
